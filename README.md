The Procurement Management System is a web-based Spring Boot application designed to streamline the procurement process by facilitating interaction between three key roles: Admin, Buyer, and Vendor. Buyers can submit product quotations, which are reviewed by the admin based on inventory availability. Admins then forward the quotations to vendors, who can apply bids. Admin reviews the received bids for each quotation and approves them to send to buyer. Among the sent bids buyer will select the bids based on his requirement. Vendor checks the bidding results and sends an invoice to the buyer regarding the approved bids. The system ensures efficient, transparent, and accountable procurement operations with role-specific access and automated notifications.
